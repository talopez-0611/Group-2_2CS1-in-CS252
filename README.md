## PART 9: Reflection Questions

## 1. What is the difference between commit and push?

Answer: A commit saves the changes locally in the Git repository.
A push uploads those commits to the remote repository in Gitea so others can see them.


## 2. Why are branches important?

Answer: Branches are important because they allow developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main branch. This makes teamwork safer and more organized.



## 3. What causes merge conflicts?
Answer: Merge conflicts happen when two branches modify the same line or file differently, and Git cannot automatically decide which change to keep.
